## big ideas
1. Make a scale for yourself and stick to it.
2. Use HSL for color

## review
I have a hunch that Tailwind is reaching its peak hype in the next year or two and will begin to be criticized afterward, but the work these two in really making UI design blunt and fast and effective can't really be understated right now. Though less jocular by a wide margin, I think it shares a lot in tone with [[dont-make-me-think|Don't Make Me Think]], in cutting past the grandeur to fixing UX problems.
