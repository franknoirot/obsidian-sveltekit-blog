You simply **aren't going to believe this.** I've finally cracked it. This is related to [[postable-thought|my previous written work]], but if that link isn't working on the website then I still have a preprocessing step to write. I also don't know how I'm supposed to inform the frontend that this link to [[philosophy-of-software-design|Philosophy of Software Design]] should resolve to a link leading to within the `/books` directory.
